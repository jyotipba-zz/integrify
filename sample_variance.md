## Explain the difference in the normalization constant in variance/covariance formula

Ans : While calculating the sample
variance, we use n-1 in stead of n, unlike while calculating the population variance. The reason we use n-1 is to get the unbiased estimator of population variance.
The sample variance is calulated
as squared of deviation of each points from mean. Since we do not know the true population mean, and we use sample mean. And it turns out that on average, deivation of data points from sample mean is less than from true mean. Hence, in order to correct this biasness we divide by n-1 instead of n.

covariance is the measure of how two random variable vary together. If covariance of two random variable is postive,they tends to move in similar direction, .ie they are positively related,and if it is negative they tends to move in inverse direction. Covariance is calulated as the sum of difference between each random variable from their  respecitve mean divided by n-1.
