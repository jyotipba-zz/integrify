### Here is the review of the functional and groupby assignment submitted by Divya and Christopher

1. All the solutions are well documented and produce the output as question expected.
2. As for the task one. i.e
 to apply a list of functions on a list of integers, as we discussed in the class, the use of for loop could have been avoided.
 After all, Good job !!
