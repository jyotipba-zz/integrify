### This is a feedback by Peter and Jyoti to Kris and his group

1) First of all, all the pandas task are completed.

2) It would be good to have comments in every cell saying what is being done

3) Also, Instead of printing whole dataframe,
how about using tail or head to view it.

4 ) In cell number 11, df.dropna(), result should be either
assgined to dataframe or inplace parameter should be
used.
