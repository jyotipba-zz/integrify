### This is a review to Pandas exercises 1, 2, and 3 submitted by Ela and Chris.

#####

First of all, all the pandas task are completed.

In Pandas exercise 1, it would be good to have some comments in every cell saying what is being done

Also, In some place, instead of printing whole dataframe, how about using tail or head to view it.

Otherwise, Nice solutions and Good job !!
