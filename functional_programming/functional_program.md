##### What is functional programming ?
Ans : Functional programming is a
programming paradigm that treats the computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids the change of state of data and mutability of data. In functional programing paradigm,
functions and expression should not have any side effects, meaning
it should not modify the state of variable outside of its scope.
We can implement functional programing in python by using
method like filter, map and reduce.
